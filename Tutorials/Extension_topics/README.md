## Environment

Tutorial A.1 requires a `conda` environment to run. 

The `IGWN` conda environment is advised: [documentation](https://computing.docs.ligo.org/conda/).

Instructions on setting up your own environment are available [on this page](https://github.com/gw-odw/odw-2023/blob/main/setup.md) (option 3).
